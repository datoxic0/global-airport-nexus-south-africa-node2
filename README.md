# Global Airport Nexus - South Africa Node
> Strategic Airport Intelligence System

## 📋 Executive Summary
The Global Airport Nexus - South Africa Node is a web-based application providing strategic intelligence related to airports, primarily focusing on South Africa but also including global data. It aggregates and normalizes airport data from various sources, displaying them on an interactive map and a searchable table. The system allows users to explore airport details, filter by region, and visualize airport clusters, aiding in aviation-related analysis and decision-making.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Interactive Mapping**: Utilizes Leaflet to display airport locations on an interactive map, allowing users to zoom, pan, and view airport details via popups.
- **Data Normalization**: Processes diverse airport data from CSV files, standardizing the data format for consistent representation and analysis.
- **Airport Table Display**: Presents airport data in a searchable and paginated table, enabling efficient data browsing and filtering.
- **Region-Specific Filtering**: Provides tools to filter airport data by region, particularly focusing on South African provinces, leveraging ISO codes for accuracy.
- **Error Handling**: Implements aggressive error suppression to mitigate issues caused by browser extensions, ensuring a stable user experience.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
**Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Rendering/Logic**: React for component-based UI, Leaflet for interactive map rendering, PapaParse for CSV parsing.
- **Structure**: Modular React components organized for data loading, normalization, map display, table rendering, and UI elements like pagination and tabs.
